Requirements for Text Classification Program

Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a Python program that uses HuggingFace text classification models to categorize text documents based on keyphrases. The program will initially implement zero-shot classification and then explore the feasibility of one-shot classification.

Functional Requirements
1. Input Handling:
   - The program should accept a list of keyphrases and a directory containing text documents as input.
   - Supported document formats must be clearly specified (e.g., .txt, .docx).

2. Model Integration:
   - Integration with HuggingFace's text classification models, starting with zero-shot classification models.
   - Facility to update or change the model for future enhancements, including exploring one-shot classification.

3. Document Processing:
   - The program should read each document in the provided directory.
   - Extract and preprocess text for classification.

4. Classification:
   - Apply the text classification model to categorize each document based on the provided keyphrases.
   - For zero-shot classification, utilize the model to categorize without prior training on the keyphrases.
   - Explore the implementation of one-shot classification, where the model is briefly trained or adjusted with an example before categorization.

5. Output Generation:
   - Generate a JSON file for each document.
   - The JSON file should contain the document's name, the list of keyphrases, and their respective scores from the classification model.

6. Error Handling:
   - The program should gracefully handle and log errors, such as unreadable files or processing errors.

Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance:
   - The program should be optimized for speed and memory usage, suitable for processing a large number of documents.

2. Scalability:
   - The design should be scalable to accommodate future enhancements, such as additional classification models or larger datasets.

3. Usability:
   - Clear documentation on how to use the program and interpret its outputs.


Dependencies
- Python (specify minimum version).
- HuggingFace Transformers library.
- Additional libraries for file handling and JSON manipulation.

Constraints
- The performance may vary based on the hardware specifications.
- Limited by the capabilities of the chosen HuggingFace models.

Future Considerations
- Exploring the implementation of other classification techniques like few-shot learning.
- Enhancing the user interface for non-technical users.
